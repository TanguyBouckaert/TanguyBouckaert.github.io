            <p class="text">
                Hello, I'm Tanguy Bouckaert, a passionate developer and game designer with a strong
                technical basis in web development and independent game production. My journey started during 
                my studies at HoGent, where I specialized in web development, Java programming, database 
                management and mobile app development (both for Android and iOS). This experience gave me the opportunity to
                gain practical knowledge in building websites, writing Java applications and creating fully functional
                web and mobile applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                To further expand my skills, I continued my studies at Howest in the field Independent Game Production via the
                Digital Arts and Entertainment Program. Here I learned to design games and create 3D models with Blender
                and Maya, and fully finished developing games with the Unity engine. This mix of technical and creative skills sets me up
                to be capable of making engaging and interactive games.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to my academic career, I am an active volunteer at my local youth movement, where I
                functioned as a youth coordinator for six years and then for two years as head of the movement. In this leadership role I was
                responsible for planning activities, managing teams and shaping the direction of the organization. This experience
                has given me valuable teamwork, communication and leadership skills that I use in my professional work.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not programming or making games, you can find me running or on the golf course—activities that
                keep me focused, disciplined and will always push me to my limits.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm always open to new challenges and collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in touch!
            </p>

                        building websites, writing Java applications, and creating fully functional web and mobile applications. Eager to expand my skill set,
                         I continued my studies at Howest in the field of Independent Game Production through the Digital Arts and Entertainment program. Here, 
                         I learned to design games, model 3D assets using Blender and Maya, and develop fully polished games using the Unity engine. This blend 
                         of technical and creative skills has equipped me to bring engaging and interactive projects to life. Outside of my academic career, 
                         I'm an active volunteer at my local youth movement, where I’ve served as a Youth Coordinator for six years and took on the role of head

                         professional work. When I’m not coding or creating games, you can find me running or practicing my golf swing—both activities that keep 
                         me focused, disciplined, and always pushing my limits. I’m always open to new challenges and opportunities to collaborate, so feel free to reach out! -->
